# Netflix Clone

JavaScript full stack application developed with the goal of demonstrating knowledge.

###  Development Process
First I created the project's layout with html and sass. If you want to see the code, you will can do it [in this repo](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Netflix-Clone-Layout "in this repo").  

The next step will be to make the API with node.js and express, you will see the process [in this repo](https://github.com/ivansevillaa/Netflix-Clone-API "in this repo").
